I'm an applied mathematician working on population dynamics, particularly on random networks, arising in various fields such as epidemiology and ecology. I am highly interested in stochastic models, such as stochastic differential equations and branching processes, as well as their (deterministic) limits. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher, working with [Nicolas Loeuille](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasloeuille/home) (IEES, Sorbonne Université) and [Manon Costa](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~mcosta/) (Institut Mathématique de Toulouse). The project focuses on understanding how different agricultural landscapes shape biodiversity, and is funded by the [Chair "Modélisation Mathématique et Biodiversité"](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/chaire-mmb/Aussois2024.html) (Veolia Environnement - École Polytechnique - Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle - Fondation X). 

During my [thesis](https://theses.fr/s299603?domaine=theses), I have considered an epidemic model with two levels of mixing, namely a uniformly mixing global level, and a local level structured into households and workplaces. Main results include insights on the epidemic footprint of the workplace size distribution, as well as the development of reduced models. This thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Vincent Bansaye](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bansaye/) (CMAP, Ecole polytechnique) and Elisabeta Vergu (Maiage, INRAE).
