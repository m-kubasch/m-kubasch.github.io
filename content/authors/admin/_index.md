Currently, I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics, under the supervision of Vincent Bansaye (CMAP, Ecole polytechnique) and Elisabeta Vergu (MaIAGE, INRAE). 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

During my PhD, I study epidemic models with two levels of mixing, namely a global level representing the general population, and a local level which is structured in households and workplaces. A key aspect of my work focuses on proposing reduced models which approximate the epidemic dynamics of interest, while being more prone to mathematical analysis and/or numerical exploration. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

From a more theoretical point of view, my interests include for instance measure-valued processes and their convergence to (deterministic) limits which emerge at the macroscopic scale.
