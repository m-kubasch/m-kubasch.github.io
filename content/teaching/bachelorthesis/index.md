During the 3rd year of the Bachelor Program, students have to write a Bachelor Thesis. This corresponds to an 8 week research project. 

As a tutor, the mission includes conceiving one or several research projects, supervising one student per project and participating in the evaluation (written thesis and oral defense) of several students.

In 2023/2024, I propose two research projects: {{% staticref "uploads/bachelor-thesis-2023-1.pdf" "newtab" %}} "Exploring the epidemic curve" {{% /staticref %}}
{{% staticref "uploads/bachelor-thesis-2023-2.pdf" "newtab" %}} "Contact heterogeneity and epidemic spread" {{% /staticref %}}

 
In 2022/2023, I have supervised the bachelor thesis of Hadi Hamdan, which consisted in an introduction to mathematical epidemiology.

The referent instructor for Applied Mathematics is Mazyar Mirrahimi.
